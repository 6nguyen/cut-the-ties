# Deployment

## Purpose
How a merge to `main` reaches production and how a pull request gets a
preview, with no manual step and no account-specific value in git. It
stops at Cloudflare's built-in analytics: no staging environment, no
monitoring; the schema is created once by hand and later columns
reach production through `seed-remote`'s add-column step (Behavior 3).

## Behavior
1. **Merge → production.** `ci` runs on the push to `main`. On success,
   `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (`workflow_run`) checks out that
   commit, runs `npm ci`, builds the site, then in order
   `scripts/quiet-check.sh deploy-worker`, `seed-remote`, `deploy-web`.
   A failing step stops the job; the previous deployment stays live.
   Order is the half-deploy guard: the Worker lands before the rows it
   reads, the rows before the pages that link to them. Logs upload as
   the `deploy-logs` artifact on failure.
2. **Worker config at deploy time.** Wrangler does not interpolate
   environment variables inside `wrangler.jsonc`, so `npm run deploy`
   and `seed:remote` first run `worker/scripts/render-deploy-config.ts`:
   it parses the checked-in `wrangler.jsonc`, replaces the placeholder
   D1 id with `D1_DATABASE_ID` (refusing to run when it is unset or
   still the placeholder) and, when `SITE_DOMAIN` is set, adds the route
   `<domain>/api/*` on that zone. The result is
   `worker/wrangler.deploy.json` (gitignored), passed with `--config`.
   Local dev and tests use `wrangler.jsonc` as is.
3. **Seed when `data/` changed.** `seed:remote` renders `seed.sql`
   from `data/` (`worker/scripts/seed-sql.ts`) and runs
   `worker/scripts/seed-remote.ts`, which applies that file only when
   its stamp differs from the database's: `seed.sql` ends with an upsert
   of `meta.seed_sha256` (SHA-256 of the rendered rows; `meta` is
   created `IF NOT EXISTS`, so no migration). The skip exists because
   D1's free tier allows 100k row writes a day and a reseed costs ~4k:
   fifteen merges on 2026-11-06 used the quota and every INSERT in the
   Worker failed for the rest of the day. `FORCE_SEED=1` applies
   regardless; `--local` targets local D1. In a reseed, `goals` and
   `actions`, which `receipts`, `reports`, `generations` and
   `screenings` reference by id, are upserted by id and only ids that
   left `data/` are deleted (an id with production references fails the
   deploy: retire it, `data/ids.md`). The other five data tables are
   deleted and re-inserted, children before parents. A wholesale
   `DELETE FROM goals` fails D1's remote foreign-key check even under
   `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys` once one production row exists (deploy
   run 42303908649, 2026-11-06). `schema.sql` (drops every table) is
   applied by `schema:remote` once, during provisioning. Before the
   stamp check, `seed-remote` runs the migrate step: for each entry of
   its `MIGRATIONS` list (`goals.decision_at`,
   `goals.decision_date_confirmed` as of 2026-11) it reads `PRAGMA
   table_info` and issues `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` only when the
   column is missing, so a column added to `schema.sql` after
   provisioning lands on the next deploy. New columns must be nullable
   or carry a default.
4. **Site.** `deploy-web` runs `wrangler pages deploy dist` from `web/`
   against the Direct Upload project `cut-ties` (`PAGES_PROJECT`
   overrides). Production is `--branch main`; the custom domain points
   at it. The Pages Function `web/functions/api/[[path]].ts` ships with
   the site and proxies `/api/*` to `API_ORIGIN`; in production the
   Worker route runs first, so it answers only on previews.
5. **Pull-request previews.** For PRs from this repository the `preview`
   job builds the site and runs `deploy-web --branch <head ref>`, then
   posts one PR comment (edited on later pushes) with the `*.pages.dev`
   URL. Forks get no preview: the job needs the repo's secrets. Until
   `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` exist both jobs
   skip their deploy steps and pass, so PRs are never blocked on
   provisioning. The preview's `/api/*` reaches the production Worker
   through the Pages Function (Preview environment variable `API_ORIGIN`
   = the Worker's workers.dev URL), so routing and read-only endpoints
   work and
   `generate` is rate-limited per device as in production.
6. **Rollback.** Re-run the last green `deploy` workflow from the
   Actions UI: it redeploys that commit's Worker, rows and site. A bad
   data change is reverted by a PR; the merge redeploys.
7. **Provisioning** is manual and documented step by step in
   `docs/guides/deploy.md`, which also holds the go-live checklist and
   the dated checklist for the 2027-01-03 district flip
   (`ACTIVE_CONGRESS=120`, `DISTRICT_VINTAGE=Current_Current`, one PR,
   rollback = revert; both district sets stay deployed).
8. **Roster workflow.** Beside `ci` and `deploy`,
   `.github/workflows/roster.yml` (maintainer-tooling §6) refreshes
   `data/members.csv` and `data/district_offices.csv` from upstream on a
   schedule and opens a data PR; merging that PR is what deploys it, by
   the same merge → seed → site path as any data change. It deploys
   nothing itself and needs no Cloudflare secret.

## Data & contracts
| Name | Set in | Read by | Without it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SITE_URL` | Pages build env (from `SITE_DOMAIN`) | `web/astro.config.mjs` | relative share-image URLs |
| `MONTHLY_COST_USD`, `STRIPE_LINKS` | GitHub Actions variables → build env | `web/src/lib/donate.ts` | `/donate` shows $0 / "link not configured" |
| `PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | GitHub Actions variable → build env | landing and act pages | no widget; `/api/route` refused once the secret is set |
| `PUBLIC_SUGGEST_PROVIDER`, `PUBLIC_SUGGEST_TOKEN` | GitHub Actions variable + secret → build env (`docs/guides/deploy.md` step 13; the token is URL-restricted to the site and preview domains) | `web/src/lib/suggest.ts` (landing combobox, `/privacy`) | plain address field, no suggestions; build warns when only one is set |
| `API_ORIGIN` | dev shell; Pages Preview variable | dev proxy; `web/functions/api/[[path]].ts` | dev → `localhost:8787`; previews answer 503 on `/api/*` |
| `MAX_GENERATIONS_PER_DAY`, `LLM_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD`, `DIGEST_FROM`, `GEOCODER_URL` | `worker/wrangler.jsonc` `vars` | Worker | code defaults (budget 15); Email Routing rejects the digest |
| `DISTRICT_VINTAGE` | `worker/wrangler.jsonc` `vars` | Worker (`geocode.ts`) | code default `ACS2025_Current` (119th map); `Current_Current` from 2027-01-03 with `ACTIVE_CONGRESS` |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `wrangler secret put` | Worker | Turnstile skipped (dev only); generation serves the standard script |
| `VISITS_ENABLED` | `worker/wrangler.jsonc` `vars` | Worker (`/api/visits*`) | on; `"0"` pauses listings (POST 503, lists empty) |
| `MAINTAINER_EMAIL` | `wrangler secret put` (a secret so the address stays out of the public repo) | Worker (digest recipient) | digest logs and exits |
| `VISITS_REVIEW_SECRET` | `wrangler secret put` | Worker (digest review links) | digest lists pending visits without links; `/api/visits/review` 503 |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `D1_DATABASE_ID` | GitHub Actions secrets | `deploy.yml` → wrangler, renderer | every deploy step fails / renderer refuses |
| `SITE_DOMAIN`, `PAGES_PROJECT` | GitHub Actions variables | renderer (route), `deploy-web` | workers.dev only; project `cut-ties` |
| `COUNT_THRESHOLD` | `worker/wrangler.jsonc` `vars` | Worker (`/api/counts`) | code default 5 |
| `IP_SALT` | `wrangler secret put` | Worker (`/api/receipt`) | `ip_hash` rotates on the UTC date only; one warning per isolate |

Files: `.env.example` (one block per name, kept in step with the code
by `worker/test/env-example.test.ts`), `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`,
`worker/scripts/render-deploy-config.ts`, `worker/wrangler.deploy.json`
(generated, gitignored), `web/functions/api/[[path]].ts`. The icon set
(`web/public/favicon.ico`, `favicon-32.png`, `mark-96.png`,
`apple-touch-icon.png`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`,
`site.webmanifest`) is committed output of `npm run icons -w web` from
`web/src/assets/logo-1024.png`; `web/test/icons.test.ts` fails when a
regeneration differs in size or pixels (not bytes: libvips' palette
quantiser differs per platform). quiet-check
targets `deploy-worker` (`npm run deploy`), `seed-remote`
(`npm run seed:remote`), `deploy-web` (`wrangler pages deploy`) are
never in `CI_TARGETS`. Bindings `DB` and `DIGEST_MAIL` are declared in
`wrangler.jsonc`, not env vars.

## Invariants (regression checklist)
- [ ] `git grep` finds no D1 id other than the zero placeholder and no
      `routes` entry in `worker/wrangler.jsonc`.
- [ ] `npm run dev`, `npm test` and `npm run build` work from a clean
      clone with no environment variable set.
- [ ] `npm run deploy -w worker` without `D1_DATABASE_ID` exits before
      contacting Cloudflare.
- [ ] `deploy.yml` steps run `deploy-worker` before `seed-remote` before
      `deploy-web`; `ci.yml` never names a deploy target.
- [ ] Every name in `.env.example` is read by code or a workflow; every
      `env.X` in `worker/src` and `process.env`/`import.meta.env`/`env.PUBLIC_*`
      read in `web/` is in `.env.example`.
- [ ] A re-run `seed:remote` leaves `receipts`, `reports`,
      `generations`, `screenings`, `blocks` and `digest_runs` untouched.
- [ ] `seed:remote` with unchanged `data/` applies nothing (the stored
      `meta.seed_sha256` matches); a data change applies the full file.
- [ ] `seed:remote` against a database missing a `MIGRATIONS` column
      adds it before the stamp check; against one that has it, issues no
      `ALTER TABLE`.
- [ ] A PR from this repo gets exactly one preview comment, updated on
      each push.

## Performance budget
A merge is live within five minutes of `ci` passing. Infra cost
excluding LLM and domain = $0/month (Pages, Workers, D1, Turnstile,
Email Routing free tiers).
