# Action router

## Purpose
Turns a street address into the visitor's House district and senators and
the two open goals where their call matters most this week. It stops at the
two goal cards. The goal overview, goal detail and prep pages, `/donate`,
`/about` and `/privacy` are in `goal-pages.md`; the act page, generated
documents, receipts and reports are in `personalised-documents.md`.

## Behavior
1. **Landing (`/`).** The hero is the `capitol-dome-dusk` photo, full
   bleed, under the ink treatment (`site-imagery.md`). One address field
   ("Street address, city, state"), the button "Find my actions", the line
   "Full street address, or use your location: nothing is stored." and a
   link to all goals. Below it, every active goal as a card linking to
   `/goals/<slug>`; these and the result cards (§5) carry a 16:9 photo
   band, there above the CTA. Under the field, only when the browser
   offers `navigator.geolocation`, the control "Use my location instead"
   (`on-device-districts.md`). When the Pages build sets
   `PUBLIC_SUGGEST_PROVIDER` (`mapbox` or `geoapify`, with
   `PUBLIC_SUGGEST_TOKEN`), the field is a combobox (`role="combobox"`,
   `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-activedescendant`,
   `autocomplete="off"`, a polite live count): three or more typed
   characters followed by 250 ms idle request up to five US street
   addresses, each shown as "street, city, ST ZIP" built from the
   provider's structured fields; the open list shows the provider's
   attribution under it; ArrowDown/ArrowUp move the highlight, Enter or a
   tap picks it (§3), Escape or blur closes. A new keystroke aborts the
   request in flight; a failure, a 429 or a 2 s timeout closes the list
   with no message. With `none` (§Data & contracts) the plain field
   renders unchanged. A return visitor with a stored district and an open
   commitment sees the "Your week" card above the field
   (`commitment-funnel.md` §3) instead of the redirect in §6.
2. **ZIP or partial input.** A bare ZIP (`\d{5}(-\d{4})?`) is refused
   before any lookup with "A ZIP code is not enough: many cities are split
   between districts. Enter your street address." Input shorter than eight
   characters or without a house number is refused as incomplete. Neither
   calls the geocoder. A bare ZIP or text under three characters also
   never triggers a suggestion request.
3. **Lookup.** The Worker sends the address to the Census Geocoder
   (`geographies/onelineaddress`, benchmark `Public_AR_Current`, vintage
   = Worker var `DISTRICT_VINTAGE`, `ACS2025_Current` = 119th map until
   2027-01-03) and reads the district layer and state; `VINTAGE_OVERRIDES`
   re-queries Missouri once by coordinates (`on-device-districts.md`).
   At-large districts (`00`, `98`) are district 0. The location path
   never reaches the geocoder: the browser resolves a one-time position
   against `/districts/*.json` and posts `{state, district, by_location:
   true}`. A denied or failed position shows "No location shared. Enter
   an address instead."; a point in no polygon shows "We couldn't place
   that point. Enter an address."; both focus the address field and open
   the state + district picker. A picked address suggestion never
   reaches the geocoder either: the label fills the field, the browser
   loads only `/districts/<STATE>.json` for the suggestion's state
   (`resolveInState`, `on-device-districts.md` §2), places the
   suggestion's coordinates with the same point-in-polygon and posts
   `{state, district, by_suggestion: true}`; a point in no district of
   that state falls through to the free-text path below with the
   suggestion's label as the address. The typed text, the suggestion and
   its coordinates are never stored.
4. **Unresolved.** No match returns 404 `unresolved` with "retry, or pick
   your state and district"; the page shows the message, keeps the field
   and opens a state + district picker that posts `{state, district}` and
   skips the geocoder. When a suggestion provider is set the page shows
   "We could not place that address. Pick one of the suggestions, check
   the address, or pick your state and district." instead of the Worker's
   text (`UNRESOLVED_WITH_SUGGESTIONS` in `AddressForm.tsx`); `none`
   keeps the Worker's message. A state/district with no members in `data/` returns
   404 `no_delegation`.
5. **Results (`/results`).** Header `<STATE-NN> · change address`, H1
   "Your two actions this week", one line naming the delegation ("Your
   people in Congress for <where>: …"), then two summary cards
   (`results-pages.md` §1), each linking `/results/<goal>`, where the
   result card renders: category chip, title, countdown stamp or
   past decision date (`countdown-stamp.md`), summary, one card per
   target with its party, role, name, phone as `tel:`, position chip,
   prior-vote line and source link (`target-cards.md`), the ask text and
   a CTA to `/goals/<goal>/act/<action>`. The page header carries one
   stamp for the soonest target across both slots. When both leadership
   goals are eligible they share one slot: the higher-scoring goal is
   the card and the other rides on it as `also` (the split card's anatomy:
   `results-pages.md` §2). A
   Democratic-caucus seat whose race is not called shows "<Chamber>
   seat: race not called yet." in its block's place. A
   member-elect target shows the role "Representative-elect" or
   "Senator-elect", the line "Takes office <date>, replaces <name>" and a
   hazard "Contact" square (arrow glyph, `aria-label="Contact <name>"`)
   linking `contact_url` when it has no phone (never a `tel:` or the
   switchboard). No eligible goal: a message and a `/goals` link. One column at 390 px, two from 1024 px. "Change address" clears the stored district and returns to `/`. Under each card's
   target stack the `Counts` island adds one line ("12 constituents in
   TX-35 called this week", else the state line, else nothing) from `GET /api/counts`; buckets below the threshold arrive
   as 0 and the line waits for the response (`district-counters.md`).
6. **Return visit.** The browser keeps only `{state, district}` in
   `localStorage` (`cut-ties:place`); `/` redirects straight to `/results`,
   which re-posts the stored pair, unless an open commitment
   keeps the visitor on `/` (§1). The last route response is cached in
   `sessionStorage` (`cut-ties:route`) for the immediate navigation only.
7. **Targets per goal.** Federal goals target the representative and both
   senators; state goals target the state treasurer row. Leadership goals
   are ranked and targeted on the *incoming* delegation
   (`Delegation.incoming`, `worker/src/repo.ts`): per seat, the sitting
   member unless `not_returning`, else the `members_elect.csv` row whose
   `replaces` is that member, else an uncalled seat; the targets are the
   `caucus = D` seats of the relevant chamber, so a member-elect replaces a
   departing member and a seat flipped to the other caucus shows nothing.
   A row with `left_office` is never a target; `not_returning` keeps its
   slot for federal goals only.
   Phone is the DC number, then the first in-state office from
   `data/district_offices.csv` as `district_city`/`district_phone`
   (a hand-filled phone has no city); the switchboard only otherwise.

## Data & contracts
- `POST /api/route` body `{address, turnstile?}` or `{state, district,
  by_location?, by_suggestion?, turnstile?}`, plus optional `via`
  (`social-sharing.md` §6; malformed → 400 `bad_request`). 200 `{state, district, house, senators, state_row, goals}`
  where `goals` is at most two `GoalCard`s (`worker/src/route.ts`). A
  leadership `GoalCard` carries `chamber`, `uncalled: Chamber[]` (the
  Democratic-caucus seats with no called result) and, when both goals
  share the slot, `also: GoalCard` for the second chamber. A `TargetCard`
  for a member-elect has `bioguide_id` = its `elect_id` (e.g.
  `CA-11-wiener`), role "Representative-elect"/"Senator-elect", position
  `unknown`, prior vote "No recorded vote yet", `phone` from the elect
  row (null, never the switchboard) and `elect: {replaces_name,
  takes_office: '2027-01-03', contact_url}`. Every `TargetCard` carries
  `state` and `district` (null for a senator or treasurer); every
  `GoalCard` carries `decision_at` and `decision_date_confirmed`
  (`countdown-stamp.md`); a goal's `pair` block never reaches `GoalCard`
  (`results-pages.md` §Data). Receipts, reports and the
  counts line take that `elect_id` as the target id (`target_id` is free
  text). `GET /api/goals/:slug/targets` follows the same rules.
  Errors: 400 `bad_json | zip_only | incomplete | missing`, 403
  `turnstile`, 404 `unresolved | no_delegation`, 502 `upstream`; every
  error body is `{error, message}`.
- Turnstile is verified on the `{address}` body (it guards the geocode)
  when `TURNSTILE_SECRET` is set and skipped otherwise (local dev). A
  `{state, district}` body is never checked: it is the same read as
  `GET /api/goals/:slug/targets`, and the results page sends it with no
  widget on a return visit or reload. `GEOCODER_URL` overrides the Census
  base URL.
- Ranking (`worker/src/ranking.ts`): eligibility rule JSON (`always`,
  `all`, `any`, `house{field: value}`, `senator{…}`, `state{nonempty:
  […]}`) evaluated against the delegation; score = impact (`priority`,
  1–5) × urgency (`1 + 2 × max(0, 1 − min(days, 90)/90)`, 3 decimals: 3
  on the day, 2 at 45 days, 1 from 90 days or no date); ties by earlier
  decision date then slug. One eligible
  goal is padded with the state goal. Two eligible leadership goals fold
  into one slot (`slots`): the higher-ranked is the slot's goal, the other
  its `also`. A rule may test only the §5.1
  inputs (house: party, caucus, hasc, conferee, rc243, btb_cosponsor;
  senator: party, caucus, jrd_april_2026; state: any column but `state`)
  with typed values (party `D|R|I`, caucus `D|R`, flags `0|1`, text
  strings); leadership rules see the incoming delegation (`ruleInput`),
  every other rule the sitting one. `parseRule` rejects
  anything else (the seed fails). Grammar: `data/README.md`.
- Goal/action `id`s come from YAML and `data/ids.md`, never file order; a
  missing, duplicate, retired or unregistered id fails the seed.
- Browser storage: `localStorage` `cut-ties:place` = `{state, district}`;
  `sessionStorage` `cut-ties:route` = last route response;
  `localStorage` `cut-ties:device` = random per-browser id (the Worker
  stores only its SHA-256).
- `by_location: true` on the route body marks a location-path route and
  `by_suggestion: true` a picked-suggestion route; the Worker ignores
  unknown fields, so both are metric placeholders until one reads them
  (`worker/test/route.test.ts`). No new storage key: both paths save only
  the resolved `{state, district}`.
- Pages build env: `PUBLIC_SUGGEST_PROVIDER` = `none | mapbox | geoapify`
  (default `none`), `PUBLIC_SUGGEST_TOKEN` = the provider's public,
  URL-restricted token. `web/src/lib/suggest.ts`: `configuredProvider()`
  (read once in `index.astro`, warns and yields `none` on an unknown value
  or a missing token), `shouldSuggest(q)`, `suggestLoop(suggester,
  onResult, timings)` (debounce, abort, timeout, failure → `[]`) and
  `suggest(q, signal): Promise<Suggestion[]>`, `Suggestion = {label, state,
  lon, lat}`. One adapter per provider maps the response, builds the label
  from structured fields (`shortLabel`) and drops results without a house
  number, city, two-letter state, ZIP or point; a non-2xx response (429
  included) rejects, which the loop turns into a closed list:
  - Mapbox: `GET https://api.mapbox.com/search/geocode/v6/forward?q=…&autocomplete=true&country=us&types=address&limit=5&proximity=ip&access_token=…`;
    `state` from `properties.context.region.region_code`, the point from
    `geometry.coordinates`.
  - Geoapify: `GET https://api.geoapify.com/v1/geocode/autocomplete?text=…&filter=countrycode:us&limit=5&apiKey=…`;
    features with `properties.housenumber`, `state` from
    `properties.state_code`, `lon`/`lat` from properties.
  `PROVIDER_NAME` gives the name `/privacy` prints. Mapbox's geocoding
  terms allow responses only "in conjunction with a Mapbox map", which
  this on-device use is not, so the flag flip uses `geoapify`; the Mapbox
  adapter stays behind the flag. Picking calls `resolveInState(state,
  lon, lat)` from `web/src/lib/pip.ts`, then `route({state, district,
  by_suggestion: true})`; `null` → `route({address: label})`.

- Goal pages, `GET /api/goals`, the goal lifecycle, seed validation of
  goal rows and the donation config are in `goal-pages.md`; a `GoalCard`
  and a `TargetCard` share the row shapes defined there.
- Actions: optional `office: dc | district` (default `dc`, D1 `NOT NULL
  DEFAULT 'dc'`, else the seed fails) names the office that handles the
  ask; cards and `targetContact` carry only its number
  (`call-the-right-office` §1).

## Invariants (regression checklist)
- [ ] The address is never logged, stored or echoed: the only outbound
      requests carrying typed text are the suggestion calls from the
      browser to the configured provider and, for a free-text submit, the
      Worker's geocoder call; a picked suggestion never reaches the
      Worker: the route body carries only `{state, district,
      by_suggestion}` and the response body contains no address
      (`web/src/lib/suggest.test.ts`,
      `web/src/components/AddressForm.test.tsx`,
      `worker/test/route.test.ts`).
- [ ] A ZIP-only submission never reaches the geocoder.
- [ ] The district parser reads `BASENAME`, then `GEOID`, then a legacy
      `CD<nnn>` field, so a Census rename never makes every address
      `unresolved` (`worker/test/route.test.ts`).
- [ ] A failed submit resets the Turnstile widget, so the retry carries
      a fresh token.
- [ ] Two slots for a resolved district, each with ≥1 target; an
      all-Republican delegation with no incoming change gets the NDAA
      goal plus the state goal.
- [ ] Leadership-goal targets caucus with the Democrats and come from the
      incoming delegation: a departing member's elect replaces them, an
      uncalled seat is a line, a flipped seat is nothing
      (`worker/test/leadership.test.ts`).
- [ ] Every number and name on a card traces to a `data/` row, never an
      LLM. Every dollar amount a state target shows equals the
      `states.csv` cell (`web/src/components/Target.test.ts`); a
      `none` state shows "holds none" with a source link and an `unknown`
      state links the research file.
- [ ] `/api/route` never writes to D1.
- [ ] Fixture delegations D/DD, D/RR, R/DD, R/RR, R/DR, D/DR (one in a
      split city) resolve to the goals in `worker/test/fixtures.ts`.
- [ ] A goal rule naming an unknown field, value type or key fails
      `npm run seed` and `parseRule`.
- [ ] Adding, renaming or removing a goal/action file moves no other id
      (`worker/test/ids.test.ts`).
- [ ] No coordinate is ever sent or logged: during the location path the
      only requests are `GET /districts/<name>.json` (no query string) and
      `POST /api/route {state, district, by_location}`
      (`web/src/lib/pip.test.ts` asserts the loader names).
- [ ] Suggestion requests never fire for a bare ZIP, text under three
      characters, or when the provider flag is `none`; a failed suggestion
      request never shows an error or blocks a submit
      (`web/src/lib/suggest.test.ts`,
      `web/src/components/AddressForm.test.tsx`).
