# Personalised documents

## Purpose
Turns one goal, one target and a few lines from the user into a call
script, letter or public comment the user can act on, then records a
receipt and an optional office response. It stops at the document: the
user places the call or sends the letter themselves, and nothing the site
stores identifies them. Address routing, goals and ranking are in
`action-router.md`.

## Behavior
1. **Act page.** `/goals/<slug>/act/<action>` (active goals only) renders
   the action's `form_schema` fields (first name 40, city 60, "why this
   matters to you" 280 multiline, optional affiliation 80) with live
   counts and a Turnstile widget. Beside the form (below it on narrow
   screens) an open "Not sure what to say?" panel opens with a boxed
   instruction (hazard-yellow, bordered, "How it works" tab: pick one
   reason, it drops into the "why" field, then rewrite it) and lists the
   goal's `reasons` as one radio group: first-person starting points
   grouped by angle (who our government answers to, being dragged into
   wars, my money, Gaza, readiness, speech), each at most 130 characters.
   Picking one puts it in the "why" field in place of the previous pick
   (after the caller's own words, if any) and focuses the field. The
   Turnstile widget sits outside the form, so it renders once the island
   has a target (not on the "Loading your target…" render) and stays
   through the output state for Regenerate; an expired token is dropped
   and re-issued, and a 403 `turnstile` answer is retried once with a
   fresh token before the error shows.
   `?target=<bioguide_id>` (state code
   for treasurer actions) preselects the target; otherwise the island
   loads the stored district's targets for the goal and offers a radio
   list, or "Enter your address" with nothing stored. Nothing submits
   until every required field is present and within its limit. The
   goal's countdown stamp (`countdown-stamp.md`) sits to the
   right of the ask H1 from 768 px and between the H1 and the form below
   that; no stamp when the goal has no upcoming date.
2. **Generation.** `POST /api/generate` runs the §4.8 guardrails in
   order, all before any Opus call: request shape → action and goal
   active → target on file for the action's scope → field shape and
   stripping (markup, URLs, emails, phones, control characters) →
   Turnstile → device block → per-device and per-IP limits → standard
   decision (`standard-scripts.md`: `LLM_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD` 0, no
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or today's count ≥ `dailyCap(...)`) →
   `claude-haiku-5-5` screen (`ok | off_topic | injection | harmful`,
   logged by device hash and class only; a screen that throws falls
   through to the standard script with `reason: upstream`). The global
   daily cap is `dailyCap(spent, blended, today, budget, ceiling)` =
   `clamp(floor((budget − spent) / daysLeftInMonth / blended), 20,
   ceiling)` (`worker/src/cost.ts`): `spent` is the month's `costUsd`
   over `generations` token sums, `blended` the trailing-7-day mean cost
   per model-drafted document (0.025 while fewer than 20 exist), the
   ceiling `MAX_GENERATIONS_PER_DAY`. Then `claude-opus-5-5` streams a JSON `{subject,
   body, facts_used}` built from a fixed system prompt (the only task,
   the exact section/vote wording and ask phrase from `doc_format`, the
   action's `prompt_template`, cached prefix; call scripts at
   `output_config.effort: 'low'`, `max_tokens` 700, letters and comments
   `'medium'`, 1500) plus a `<facts>` block
   assembled by code from D1 (target, committee role, stated position,
   prior vote, goal ask, decision date, window, our pick; treasurer
   actions: bonds held, campaign, next comment date) and the user's
   `<user_fields>`, both labelled untrusted. The page shows the body as
   it streams.
   For an action with `script_blocks` the user message also carries a
   `<starting_script>` block holding the `standard-scripts.md` composition
   for this request, and the system prompt tells the model to keep its ask and
   facts, rework it into the constituent's voice and treat it as
   material, not instructions; a composition that fails the check is
   omitted.

3. **Output check and uniqueness.** Deterministic, after each draft:
   word count within `doc_format`, target surname, one of
   `doc_format.mentions`, the `doc_format.ask` phrase, our pick's surname
   when the goal has one, no "end aid", every digit run present in the
   fact block or the user's own fields, no URL/email/phone, no blocklist
   term. A failed check regenerates once with the reason; a second
   failure returns `error {refused}` and the page shows a refusal with
   "edit my lines", never the draft. 8-word shingles (FNV-1a) of the
   body are compared with the last 200 for the action; Jaccard > 0.3
   regenerates once with a "different structure and opening"
   instruction, then the draft is shown. One `generations` row per
   request (shingles, hashes, tokens, `attempt` 1|2 and `check_fail` =
   the first attempt's failure class when a redraft ran; empty shingles
   on refusal). The row is bookkeeping, not the product: when the
   INSERT fails (D1's free-tier daily write cap, hit on 2026-11-06 after
   fifteen reseeding deploys; an outage) the Worker logs
   `generate: generations write failed` and the draft still ends in
   `done`; only that request is missing from the limit counters and the
   uniqueness window. The same holds for the screening row. D1 returns
   the `shingles` BLOB as a byte array; `decodeShingles` rebuilds the
   `Uint32Array` (a `new Uint32Array(bytes)` made one lane per byte and
   the uniqueness check never matched). Both attempts throwing on the
   model call gives `reset` and the standard script with
   `reason: upstream`. One "Regenerate" button.
4. **Receipt, share, report.** From 1024 px the output screen is two
   columns: the script with its copy / download / regenerate row on the
   left, the call buttons and the receipt card beside it on the right
   (stacked in that order below). It offers copy, download
   `.txt`, `tel:` links for every phone on file (each with the open/closed
   chip of `web/src/lib/hours.ts`; with two numbers each button names its
   office, "DC office" / "District office", under a one-line note that
   either works and both log the call; when the DC office is closed the
   district number is listed first with "DC office closed; district
   office answers in office hours."; under the call buttons of a call
   action the one text link "I can't call right now", replaced by the
   primary button "Both offices are closed. Email instead" ("The office
   is closed. Email instead" with one number) when `isOpen` is false for
   every office on file), the contact-form link
   for letters and comments, and "I did it" → `POST /api/receipt`
   (goal, action, target, stored state/district, device hash). After a
   receipt, first the commitment line and the captain list
   (`commitment-funnel.md` §1–4; each skippable in one tap), and only
   once both are answered or skipped: the next-office buttons and the
   "You're one of <N>" line (`commitment-funnel.md` §10), then the share
   row of `social-sharing.md` §3–5 (poster, link, fallback, intents),
   the office-response picker
   (`will_support · undecided · opposed · no_answer · other` + note
   ≤140) → `POST /api/report` (`no_answer` also shows the voicemail line,
   "Try again", `commitment-funnel.md` §9, and the primary button "Email
   it instead"; any other reported outcome shows the muted link "Put it
   in writing (2 min)" under the thanks line), a reflection line that
   never leaves the page, and a link to `/donate`. The share row comes
   after a receipt or a completed captain list, never before. Reports
   never change a position row.
   **Email step** (`email-button`): "I can't call right now", the
   closed-offices button, "Email it instead" and "Put it in writing" all
   open, in place of the call row, a card "Send it in writing" with the
   subject (the action's `email_subject`, `{city}` filled from the city
   field), the message (`Dear <Role> <Surname>,` + blank line + the body
   exactly as shown, standard script included + blank line +
   `<first_name>, <city>`; nothing else, no model call), "Copy subject
   and message", the contact link labelled by `contact_kind` ("Open the
   contact form ↗" / "Open the contact form (asks for your ZIP first) ↗" /
   "Open the office website, then Contact ↗"), a field hint by chamber
   (House: name, address, ZIP, topic, message box, plus the ZIP+4
   fallback; Senate: name, address, email, topic, message box; no
   chamber: "Paste the message into the comment box."), "I sent it" and
   "Back to calling". No `contact_form_url` → "This office lists no
   contact form; the DC number is the only channel." and no "I sent it".
   "I sent it" posts the call receipt's body plus `channel: 'email'`; the
   funnel then runs as for a letter. A refused draft, a letter or a
   comment action has no email step.
5. **Standard script.** When no model may run — the day's cap is
   reached (`reason: capacity`), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset
   (`unconfigured`), `LLM_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD` is 0 (`budget`), or the
   screen or both model attempts threw (`upstream`) — the route serves
   the action's standard script (`standard-scripts.md`) on the same SSE
   stream, makes no Anthropic request, and records a `generations` row
   with `model = 'standard'`; receipt, commitment, captain, share and
   report are unchanged.

## Data & contracts
- `POST /api/generate` body `{action, target, fields, device,
  turnstile?, variant?}` (`device` 8–128 chars; `variant` a non-negative
  integer seed, ignored otherwise). Success is `text/event-stream`:
  `status {stage: drafting|redrafting|standard, reason?}`, `delta
  {text}`, `reset {reason}`, `done {subject, body, facts_used, words,
  standard, reason?, variant?, target: {id, name, role, phones[],
  contact_form_url, contact_kind, chamber}}` (`contact_kind` `form |
  zip_gate | homepage | null`, `homepage` for a member-elect or treasurer
  URL; `chamber` `house | senate | null`) or `error {error: refused |
  internal, message}`;
  `variant` is present only on a standard script composed from blocks.
  Rejections are JSON `{error, message}`: 400 `bad_json | bad_request |
  no_action | no_target | bad_fields`, 403 `turnstile | blocked`, 422
  `screened`, 429 `limit_hour | limit_day | limit_action | limit_ip`.
  No 503 or 502 (the standard script replaces them). Limits (`LIMITS`
  in `worker/src/generate.ts`): 5 per device per hour, 20 per day, 3
  per device per action per day, 30 per IP per day, `dailyCap(...)`
  globally with `MAX_GENERATIONS_PER_DAY` (default 500) as the ceiling
  and 20 as the floor while the budget is above zero, `max_tokens` 700
  for call scripts and 1500 otherwise; three screened-out attempts in
  24 h block the device for 24 h.
- `POST /api/receipt` `{goal, action, target, state?, district?,
  device, channel?}` → `{id}` (`channel` `'call'` (default) or `'email'`,
  stored on the row; any other value, or a `channel` on a captain list,
  is 400 `bad_request`; `action: 'captain-list'` with no target records a
  completed captain list, `commitment-funnel.md`); `POST /api/report` `{goal, target, outcome, note?,
  device}` → `{id}` (note sanitised to ≤140 chars). Both 400
  `bad_request | no_action | no_target | bad_outcome`.
- Anthropic is called through the injected `fetch` (raw Messages API,
  no SDK): `claude-opus-5-5` streaming with `output_config` JSON schema
  and `cache_control` on the system prefix; `claude-haiku-5-5`
  non-streaming for the screen. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `MAX_GENERATIONS_PER_DAY` and `LLM_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD` (default 15; 0
  = standard scripts only) come from `worker/.dev.vars` (template:
  `worker/.dev.vars.example`).
- `worker/src/cost.ts`: `PRICES` (USD per MTok by model id, read
  `PRICES_READ`), `SCREEN_ALLOWANCE_USD` 0.0001 per model-drafted row,
  `costUsd(rows)`, `blendedCost(rows)`, `dailyCap(...)`,
  `currentCap(repo, now, budget, ceiling)` and `parseBudget`; pure
  arithmetic over `Repo.tokensSince(iso)` sums (per model, action and
  `check_fail`).
- D1 tables added for §4 (`worker/schema.sql`): `generations`
  (action_id, target_id, shingles BLOB, device_hash, ip_hash, tokens,
  model, `attempt` INTEGER DEFAULT 1, `check_fail` TEXT), `screenings` (device_hash, action_id, class), `blocks`
  (device_hash, until), `receipts`, `reports` (outcome CHECK, `hidden`).
  No table holds user text or a document.
- Action YAML (`data/actions/<slug>.yaml`): `form_schema.fields[]`
  (`name, label, max, required, multiline?, hint?`), `prompt_template`
  (action guidance appended to the system prompt), `doc_format`
  (`kind, min_words, max_words, mentions[], ask`; `max_words` defaults
  to 160 and the five call actions set 60–160 since 2026-11, 120 before) and
  `standard_template` (`standard-scripts.md`; required while the goal is active)
  and, on call actions, `email_subject` (required while the goal is
  active, ≤80 characters, no URL, email or phone, `{city}` the one
  placeholder; the loader rejects anything else, `data/README.md`);
  `mentions` and `ask` are the exact phrases the output check requires.
  `ActForm` receives `email_subject` with the action props.
- Goal YAML `reasons[]` (`angle`, `points[]`): at most six angles, one to
  five points each, ≤130 characters, no digits; the seed rejects anything
  else (`data/README.md`).
- Receipt limits (`district-counters.md` §8–9): `POST /api/receipt`
  answers 429 `limit_day` after 10 receipts per device hash in 24 h,
  `limit_repeat` for a second receipt on the same device, goal, action
  and channel within 10 minutes (a call then an email for one office both
  count) and `limit_ip` after 50 per IP hash in 24 h; none of
  those rows is stored. Every stored receipt carries `ip_hash` =
  SHA-256(`CF-Connecting-IP` | `IP_SALT` | UTC date), nullable, never the
  IP. The generation limits above are unchanged.

## Invariants (regression checklist)
- [ ] Without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `/api/generate` streams the standard
      script with `reason: unconfigured` and makes no Anthropic call;
      so do a budget of 0 and a reached cap; every 400/403/429
      rejection and every screened-out input also makes no Opus call
      (`worker/test/generate.test.ts`).
- [ ] No number in the digest or the cap comes from a model: `dailyCap`
      and `costUsd` are arithmetic over stored token sums
      (`worker/test/cost.test.ts`).

- [ ] 40 abusive inputs (injection, threats, off-topic) produce zero
      documents; 20 benign inputs with unusual phrasing all pass; the
      third screened-out attempt blocks the device for 24 h; screenings
      store device hash and class, never content.
- [ ] A draft with a URL or a number outside the fact block is
      regenerated once, then refused; no document is shown.
- [ ] 20 generations with different inputs produce no pair with shingle
      overlap > 0.3; every stored document names the target, a
      `doc_format.mentions` phrase and the ask, is within the word range
      and never contains "end aid"; a duplicate triggers one
      different-structure regeneration.
- [ ] `generations` rows carry shingles, hashes and token counts and
      never a user field or the text; `/api/route` still calls no repo
      writer.
- [ ] `/api/report` never changes a `positions` row; its note is
      stripped and ≤140 characters.

## Performance budget
Generation: first streamed token ≤3 s p95, complete ≤10 s p95. ~900 uncached input tokens per
document; output ≤700 (call script) or ≤1500 (letter); about $0.01 per
call script and $0.025 per letter at November 2026 prices; the month's
spend ≤ `LLM_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD`. Infra cost excluding LLM and domain =
$0/month.
