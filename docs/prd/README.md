# PRDs — one file per change

`docs/specs/` describes the app as shipped today. A PRD here is a **change**:
a proposal with an explicit `## Spec delta`, approved **before** code. A PRD
opened as a PR is APPROVED on creation unless it has a `[blocking]` open
question (see the template's `## Open questions`); the owner can still reject
it in review.

## Lifecycle
Specced in `docs/specs/prd-lifecycle.md` (template repo only). The spec is
the source of truth; a change to one updates the other in the same PR.

1. **Propose.** Read `docs/FEATURES.md` first (what exists, is building or
   is queued). `docs/prd/<change>.md` from the template below, including
   `## Spec delta`; delete the `## Next` row it replaces in the same commit. Add its row to the index below at its priority (rules under
   `## Index`). A brand-new capability's delta is ADDED: the whole spec
   file (template in `docs/specs/README.md`).
2. **Build.** `/implement-prd-section` loads the PRD range plus only the spec
   sections the delta names. State is read and written only through
   `state.sh get|set`; `prd-lint.sh <prd>` runs before every PRD commit.
3. **Fold.** When a section merges, its delta is applied to `docs/specs/` in
   that same PR and State records `Folded: §…`.
4. **Ship.** The PR that ships the final section (State `Remaining: none`)
   also sets Status `SHIPPED YYYY-MM-DD (PR #n)`, `git mv`s the PRD to
   `archive/YYYY-MM-<change>.md`, removes its row from the index below and
   deletes its pointer lines from the root `CLAUDE.md`.
5. **Superseded or abandoned** PRDs move to `archive/` with Status
   `SUPERSEDED by <prd>` or `DROPPED`, no fold, and the same pointer
   deletion.

A PRD pointer is one root `CLAUDE.md` line carrying
`<!-- prd-pointer: docs/prd/<change>.md -->`. Archiving a PRD deletes every
line with its marker, in the same commit as the `git mv`; these are the only
`CLAUDE.md` lines any process removes automatically.

No PRD and no spec change: refactors and fixes that restore specced
behavior. A fix that *changes* specced behavior edits the spec directly in
the fix PR and gives the reason in the commit body (a PRD only if the owner
asks). `archive/` is history only: archived PRDs are never edited and agents
never load them.

## Index (open changes only, in priority order)
This table is the one state holder for every open PRD. Row 1 is the next
PRD to build; `Needs` names the PRDs that must merge first, and a row with
no `Needs` entry can run in parallel with the row above it. Rules:
- Creating a PRD inserts its row at its priority and renumbers the rest;
  rows are never appended by default. Buildable rows rank above rows
  blocked on the owner, counsel or a date.
- `Status` mirrors the PRD's `Status:` line, with the blocked or
  in-progress section and its reason in parentheses; the same commit that
  changes a PRD's Status or State block updates its row.
- A PRD that ships, is superseded or is dropped loses its row in the
  commit that archives it (Lifecycle 4–5); completed work never stays here.
- `prd-lint` fails on a `docs/prd/*.md` without a row, a row whose PRD is
  missing or archived, and a row whose Status word differs from the PRD's.

| # | PRD | Status | Needs | Owner surfaces |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [deploy.md](deploy.md) | BUILDING (§3 owner checklist) | — | Cloudflare provisioning and CI deploy on merge are live at cutthetiesmovement.org; §3 is the owner's go-live checklist with measured numbers |
| 2 | [social-sharing.md](social-sharing.md) | BUILDING (§1 owner device test) | — | On-device 1080×1920 poster shared file-only to the OS sheet (Instagram first), fallback download + caption + intent links, `?via=share` counted in the digest; §1 is a half-day owner device test |
| 3 | [site-imagery.md](site-imagery.md) | APPROVED | — | `web/src/assets/img/` + manifest, `Photo.astro`, landing/results/goal heroes, portraits on targets and member pages, share-card photo; §1–§5 buildable now |
| 4 | [state-holdings-sweep.md](state-holdings-sweep.md) | BUILDING (§2 research) | — | `draft-holding`, `states.csv` checks, 50-state sweep; maintainer research, runs alone |
| 5 | [primary-2028.md](primary-2028.md) | BUILDING (§2 blocked) | — | `electoral` goal per 2028 target, `data/elections.csv`; §2 picks wait for counsel; stays `upcoming` until the NDAA goal closes |
| 6 | [district-vintage-rollover.md](district-vintage-rollover.md) | BUILDING (§3 blocked until 2027-01-03) | — (§3 date-gated 2027-01-03) | §1–2 shipped (PR #32); §3 dated flip on 2027-01-03 per `docs/guides/deploy.md` §6 |

## Next (ideas without a PRD, in intended order; ≤10)
Targets is an existing spec stem or `new`. Writing the PRD deletes its row
in the same commit; dropping an idea deletes its row.
| # | Idea | Targets | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Weekly social-trend watch: which frames about Jeffries, Schumer, the military bill and Israel are moving on Instagram, TikTok and search; proposes goal-title and `this_week` changes as a PR | maintainer-tooling | Needs a logged-in trend source or a listening tool; never edits `data/` on its own; follows `plain-english-copy` |

## Template (copy for a new feature)

## Problem
What is wrong or missing today, in one paragraph, with the evidence.

## Goals / Non-goals
- Goals: the 2–5 outcomes this must achieve.
- Non-goals: what we deliberately leave out (and why).

## Research (what the best products do → adopt / adapt / reject)
Relies on: links to the `docs/research/<topic>.md` files behind this PRD, or
omit the line. The PRD states every decision a build needs; builds never
read research.
| Pattern | Seen in | Verdict | Why |

## Users
Who uses this and how their needs differ (copy, density, defaults).

## Expected behavior
Numbered, screen by screen. Each step: what the user sees, what they can do,
what happens next, edge cases (empty data, offline, first run vs return).

## Data & contracts
New/changed endpoints, models, settings keys, persisted client state.

## Spec delta
One entry per `docs/specs/<file>.md` § heading this change touches. Each is
ADDED (new text), MODIFIED (old → new) or REMOVED. A new capability is one
ADDED entry: the whole spec file. Example:
- MODIFIED `docs/specs/home.md` §Behavior 3: streak resets after 1 missed day → after 2 missed days.

## Acceptance criteria
Checkbox list a tester can verify without reading code, including failure
paths and the performance budget (from CLAUDE.md §Performance budgets).

## Rollout & metrics
Feature flag? Migration? What we measure to know it worked.

## State (updated YYYY-MM-DD, PR #n) — medium/long features only; ≤30 lines
- Sections: (build order; `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` merged · `[!]` blocked: reason)
  - [x] <heading text> · PR #n merged
  - [~] <heading text> · <branch> · PR #n
  - [ ] <heading text>
- Completed: …
- Folded: §… (spec deltas applied to `docs/specs/` so far)
- Branch / open PRs: …
- Files changed (file:line map): …
- Tests run + result: …
- Remaining: …
- Decisions since last update: …
- Known failures / blockers: …
- Next action: …
The implementing session updates this in the same PR. A fresh session
resumes from this block, not from conversation history. `Sections:` items
are heading text (prefix match, no line numbers); `/implement-prd-section`
with no range picks the next one and both it and `/handoff` keep the
markers current (merged PRs flip to `[x]` on the next run).

## Open questions
Numbered. Each has a `Proposal:`. Mark one `[blocking]` only if its answer
changes Expected behavior, Data & contracts, Acceptance criteria or scope, or
is costly to reverse. No blocking questions → Status `APPROVED YYYY-MM-DD
(auto)` at PR creation, proposals become decisions, logged under Changes.
Any blocking question → Status `DRAFT`, PR body lists them, no code yet.

## Changes
- YYYY-MM-DD — created (DRAFT).
