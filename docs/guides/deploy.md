# Deploy — provisioning runbook and go-live checklist

How the maintainer stands production up once, what a merge to `main`
does afterwards, and the checklist ticked on first launch. Current
behavior lives in `docs/specs/deployment.md`; variables in `.env.example`.

## 1. One-time provisioning (in order)
Run from the repo root unless noted. `<domain>` is the apex domain,
`cutthetiesmovement.org` (decided 2026-11-08, `docs/prd/deploy.md` open
question 1). Steps 1–12 are done; §5 is what remains.

1. Log in: `npx wrangler login` (any directory; opens the browser).
2. Create the database: `cd worker && npx wrangler d1 create cut_ties`.
   Copy the printed `database_id`; it never goes into git:
   `export D1_DATABASE_ID=<id>` for this shell (step 11 stores it in
   GitHub). `wrangler.jsonc` keeps the zero placeholder for local dev.
3. Create the schema once (drops every table; never re-run on a live
   database): `D1_DATABASE_ID=<id> npm run schema:remote -w worker`.
4. Secrets, from `worker/`: `npx wrangler secret put <NAME>` for
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `IP_SALT` and `VISITS_REVIEW_SECRET` (any long
   random string, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`), `MAINTAINER_EMAIL` (the
   address the digest goes to; a secret so it stays out of the public
   repo) and `TURNSTILE_SECRET` (from step 9; put it after that step).
5. Worker vars in `worker/wrangler.jsonc` → `vars` (committed):
   `DIGEST_FROM` (`digest@<domain>`; its domain is also the origin of
   the digest's approve/reject links), `MAX_GENERATIONS_PER_DAY`.
6. First Worker deploy, workers.dev only until the domain exists:
   `D1_DATABASE_ID=<id> npm run deploy -w worker`. Note the
   `https://cut-ties-api.<subdomain>.workers.dev` URL it prints.
7. Seed production from `data/`: `D1_DATABASE_ID=<id> npm run
   seed:remote -w worker` (reruns are safe; deploy.yml does this on
   every merge).
8. Pages project (Direct Upload, so deploy.yml and PR previews publish
   through `wrangler pages deploy`; a Git-connected project cannot take
   uploads): `npx wrangler pages project create cut-ties
   --production-branch main`. In the dashboard → Workers & Pages →
   cut-ties → Settings → Variables: add `API_ORIGIN` = the workers.dev
   URL from step 6 to the **Preview** environment only (the preview
   proxy `web/functions/api/[[path]].ts` reads it; production routes
   `/api/*` to the Worker before Pages sees it).
9. Turnstile (dashboard → Turnstile → Add widget): hostnames `<domain>`
   and `cut-ties.pages.dev`, mode Managed. Site key → GitHub variable
   `PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` (step 11); secret → step 4.
10. Domain: register `<domain>`, add the zone to Cloudflare, point the
    registrar at the assigned nameservers. Then Pages → cut-ties →
    Custom domains → add `<domain>` (and `www.<domain>` if wanted).
    Email Routing (zone → Email → Email Routing): enable, add
    `MAINTAINER_EMAIL` as a destination and confirm the verification
    mail; this is what the `DIGEST_MAIL` binding sends through.
11. GitHub → repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.
    Secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (API Tokens → Create → Edit
    Cloudflare Workers template, plus D1:Edit and Pages:Edit),
    `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `D1_DATABASE_ID`. Variables:
    `SITE_DOMAIN` (`<domain>`, no scheme), `STRIPE_LINKS` (JSON, three
    Stripe payment links: `once_5`, `monthly_1`, `custom`),
    `PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`, optionally `PAGES_PROJECT`.
12. Merge any PR to `main` (or re-run the last `deploy` workflow from
    the Actions tab). The `production` job deploys the Worker with the
    `<domain>/api/*` route, re-seeds D1 and publishes the site.
13. Address suggestions (optional; the field works without them).
    Create a Geoapify key (myprojects.geoapify.com → New project → API
    keys; free tier 3 000 requests/day, no card) or a Mapbox public
    token (account.mapbox.com → Tokens). Restrict it to
    `https://<domain>/*` and `https://cut-ties.pages.dev/*` (Geoapify
    "Allowed referrers", Mapbox "URL restrictions"): it ships in the
    page source, so a copied key must be useless elsewhere. Then GitHub
    → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions: variable
    `PUBLIC_SUGGEST_PROVIDER=geoapify` (or `mapbox`) and secret
    `PUBLIC_SUGGEST_TOKEN=<key>`; `deploy.yml` passes both to the Pages
    build. With only one set the build warns
    `PUBLIC_SUGGEST_PROVIDER=… without PUBLIC_SUGGEST_TOKEN; suggestions
    off` and ships the plain field. Past the daily quota the provider
    answers 429 and the list closes silently; the Census geocoder still
    resolves the typed address.

## 2. What a merge does
`ci` runs on the push to `main`; when it succeeds, `deploy.yml`'s
`production` job runs `npm ci`, builds the site, then
`scripts/quiet-check.sh deploy-worker` → `seed-remote` → `deploy-web`.
A failing step stops the job and the previous deployment stays live; the
Worker always lands before the rows it reads and the rows before the
pages that link to them. Full logs are uploaded as the `deploy-logs`
artifact on failure.

## 3. Pull-request previews
Every PR from this repo gets a `preview` job that builds the site and
runs `deploy-web --branch <head>`; the job posts (and later edits) one
comment holding the `*.pages.dev` URL (once the Cloudflare secrets are
set; before that the job skips its deploy steps and passes). The
preview's `/api/*` is proxied to the production Worker by the Pages
Function, so the landing page
routes a fixture address and read-only endpoints work; `generate` is
rate-limited per device as in production.

## 4. Rollback
Actions → `deploy` → pick the last green run → "Re-run all jobs". It
redeploys that commit's Worker, rows and site. For a bad data change,
revert the data PR instead; the merge redeploys.

## 5. Go-live checklist (tick on first launch, commit the numbers)
- [ ] `/` routes the three fixture addresses (CA-46, TX-35, PA-1) to
      their delegations.
- [ ] `/donate` shows three working Stripe links ($5 once, $1 monthly,
      custom amount); `STRIPE_LINKS` set in GitHub Actions variables.
- [ ] A generation streams end to end with the real `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- [ ] The digest ran once by manual trigger (dashboard → Worker →
      Triggers → Cron → "Trigger") and the email arrived at
      `MAINTAINER_EMAIL`.
- [ ] `curl -X POST https://<domain>/api/route -d '{"address":"x"}'`
      without a Turnstile token is refused.
- [ ] Landing transfer size ≤100 KB measured and recorded in
      `docs/specs/action-router.md` §Performance budget: ___ KB.
- [ ] LCP ≤1.5 s on a mid-range phone over 4G (Lighthouse, mobile,
      slow 4G): ___ s.
- [ ] `/api/route` p95 ≤2 s over 20 requests: ___ ms.
- [ ] First streamed token ≤3 s p95 and generation complete ≤10 s p95:
      ___ s / ___ s.
- [x] `README.md` carries the live URL (2026-11-08).
- [ ] After one week: Cloudflare billing shows $0 for Pages, Workers, D1,
      Turnstile and Email Routing.

## 6. District flip to the 120th Congress (2027-01-03, dated checklist)
Context: `docs/prd/district-vintage-rollover.md` §3. Both district sets
are already deployed (`web/public/districts/` = cd119,
`web/public/districts-120/` = cd120 with Missouri on cd119), so the flip
is one PR and the rollback is its revert. Do not open it before
2027-01-03 and merge it only after the roster PR (roster-freshness §4,
`left_office` set on departed members) has merged.
- [ ] Roster PR merged and `import-members` re-run for the 120th
      (`docs/research/data-ingestion.md`); `members.csv` keys new
      members by state and 120th district.
- [ ] `web/src/lib/pip.ts`: `ACTIVE_CONGRESS = 120`.
- [ ] `worker/wrangler.jsonc` `vars`: `DISTRICT_VINTAGE = "Current_Current"`
      (`.env.example` line to match); `VINTAGE_OVERRIDES` unchanged
      (`MO` stays on `ACS2025_Current`).
- [ ] `worker/src/districts.ts`: `SEATS_CONGRESS = 120` (counts unchanged).
- [ ] `web/src/lib/pip.test.ts`: the "ACTIVE_CONGRESS picks the
      directory" assertions flip to `120` / `/districts-120`; the
      cd120 fixture is the gate, no cd119 test changes.
- [ ] `npx tsx scripts/probe-districts.ts --set 120` prints 0 mismatches
      against `Current_Current` on the day (Census can re-cut the layer).
- [ ] `scripts/quiet-check.sh tsc`, `test`, `test-web`, `build` green;
      `/api/route` for `600 Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78701` answers
      TX-10 and `414 E 12th St, Kansas City, MO 64106` answers MO-5.
- [ ] After the deploy: a browser location in Austin requests
      `/districts-120/TX.json` only (DevTools network), landing still
      ≤100 KB; `/api/route` p95 ≤2 s including the Missouri re-query.
- [ ] One deploy later, a second PR deletes `web/public/districts/` and
      moves `districts-120/` to `districts/` with `DISTRICTS_DIR` back to
      `/districts` (or leaves the directory name; never in the flip PR).
- Rollback: revert the flip PR; cd119 files are still deployed and
  `DISTRICT_VINTAGE` returns to `ACS2025_Current`, no rebuild needed.
